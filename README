A small experiment on PEG grammars. 

Other projects that work on the same topic are: 
http://wiki.github.com/luikore/rsec/
http://github.com/nathansobo/treetop

My goal here is to see how a parser/parser generator should be constructed to
allow clean AST construction and good error handling. It seems to me that most
often, parser generators only handle the success-case and forget about
debugging and error generation.

This is in a usable alpha state, although I've only just begun working on the
above goals. Maybe I will incorporate this into rooc
(http://github.com/kschiess/rooc) one day.
