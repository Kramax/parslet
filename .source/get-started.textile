Parslet is a Parsing Expression Grammar
("PEG":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) Parser. These
are a different kind of grammars that recognize almost the same languages as
your conventional LR parser, except that they are easier to work with, since
they haven't been conceived for generation, but for recognition of languages.
