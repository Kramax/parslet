Let's develop a small language that allows for simple computation together. 
Here's a valid input file for that language: 

{% highlight ruby %} 
puts(1 + 2)
puts(4 / 2)
{% endhighlight %}

To install the parslet library, please do a 

{% highlight bash %} 
gem install parslet
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's write the first part of our parser. 

{% highlight ruby %} 
require 'parslet' 

class Mini < Parslet::Parser
  rule(:integer) { match('[0-9]').repeat(1) }
  root(:integer)
end

p Mini.new.parse("132432")
{% endhighlight %}

Running this example will print "132432". Congratulations! You just have
written your first parser.

There are just two lines to the definition of this parser, let's go through them: 

{% highlight ruby %} 
rule(:integer) { match('[0-9]').repeat(1) }
{% endhighlight %}

<code>rule</code> lets you create a new parser rule. Inside the block of that
<code>:integer</code> rule, you find <code>match('[0-9]').repeat(1)</code>. This says: "match a character that is in the range <code>0-9</code>, then 
match any number of those, but at least match one."

{% highlight ruby %} 
root(:integer)
{% endhighlight %}

That second line just says: Start parsing at the rule called
<code>:integer</code>.

h2. Addition

Let's go for simple addition. We'll have to allow for spaces in our input,
since those help make code readable. Here are two rules that will serve us
good:

{% highlight ruby %} 
rule(:space)  { match('\s').repeat(1) }
rule(:space?) { space.maybe }
{% endhighlight %}

Two things are new here: (and both in the second line)

* you can use ('call') other rules in your rules 
* <code>.maybe</code>, the same as <code>.repeat(0,1)</code>, indicating that
  the thing before it is maybe present in the input.
