h2. Thanks for all the fish -- Contributions

* *Hal Brodigan* ("postmodern":http://postmodern.github.com/) for solving our
  email parsing needs!

* *R. Konstantin Haase* ("rhk":http://rkh.im/) for rspec matchers that help
  stamp out, eliminate and abolish redundancy.

* *Florian Hanke* ("floere":http://floere.github.com) has given a lot of very
  inspiring input for parslet. His questions have been key to rounding off the
  corners and making the library as aesthetic as it is. And just look at the 
  logo. 
  
* *Kaspar Schiess* ("absurd.li":http://www.absurd.li) for being brave enough
  to actually add another parser library to a field that's already bursting
  at the seams.
