h2. Bugs 

Log in to github and open a bug ticket "here":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/issues. 
Please be sure to include the version of parslet and Ruby; maybe you can even
provide some code that exhibits the bug?

And of course if you provide a properly tested patch, you'll be my hero and 
get a place in the space below for lifetime. Just send me a pull request!

h2. Projects

Have you got a project that uses parslet? Please write
"me":mailto:kaspar.schiess@absurd.li about it. I would like to include you in
this project list:

In here, you can find a parser for a lisp like language and much more. 

h2. Thanks for all the fish

* *Florian Hanke* ("floere":floere.github.com) has given a lot of very
  inspiring input for parslet. His questions have been key to rounding off the
  corners and making the library as aesthetic as it is. And just look at the 
  logo.
