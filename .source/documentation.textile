Are you brand new to parslet? Well then let's introduce you guys. Please read 
the *Tutorial*!

Parslet has inline comments that detail some of its usage. Have a look at the 
*rdoc documentation*.

The source tree of parslet also comprises a few examples that illustrate details about how to and when to. Please refer to the *examples section*. 

Have you made a full blown parser/interpreter/compiler using parslet? I would 
be glad to link to your project here as an example for others.
