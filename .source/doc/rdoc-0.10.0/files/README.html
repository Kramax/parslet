INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
A small library that implements a PEG grammar. PEG means Parsing Expression
Grammars [1]. These are a different kind of grammars that recognize almost
the same languages as your conventional LR parser, except that they are
easier to work with, since they haven&#8217;t been conceived for
generation, but for recognition of languages. You can read the founding
paper of the field by Bryan Ford here [2].
</p>
<p>
Other Ruby projects that work on the same topic are: <a

</p>
<p>
My goal here was to see how a parser/parser generator should be constructed
to allow clean AST construction and good error handling. It seems to me
that most often, parser generators only handle the success-case and forget
about debugging and error generation.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, this library is motivated by one of my compiler
projects. I started out using &#8216;treetop&#8217; (see the link above),
but found it unusable. It was lacking in
</p>
<pre>
  * error reporting: Hard to see where a grammar fails.

  * stability of generated trees: Intermediary trees were dictated by the
    grammar. It was hard to define invariants in that system - what was
    convenient when writing the grammar often wasn't in subsequent stages.

  * clarity of parser code: The parser code is generated and is very hard
    to read. Add that to the first point to understand my pain.
</pre>
<p>
So parslet tries to be different. It doesn&#8217;t generate the parser, but
instead defines it in a DSL which is very close to what you find in [2]. A
successful parse then generates a parser tree consisting entirely of hashes
and arrays and strings (read: instable). This parser tree can then be
converted to a real AST (read: stable) using a pattern matcher that is also
part of this library.
</p>
<p>
Error reporting is another area where parslet excels: It is able to print
not only the error you are used to seeing (&#8216;Parse failed because of
REASON at line 1 and char 2&#8217;), but also prints what led to that
failure in the form of a tree (error_tree method).

SYNOPSIS
</p>
<pre>
  require 'parslet'
  include Parslet

  # Constructs a parser using a Parser Expression Grammar like DSL:
  parser =  str('&quot;') &gt;&gt;
            (
              str('\\') &gt;&gt; any |
              str('&quot;').absnt? &gt;&gt; any
            ).repeat.as(:string) &gt;&gt;
            str('&quot;')

  # Parse the string and capture parts of the interpretation (:string above)
  tree = parser.parse(%Q{
    &quot;This is a \\&quot;String\\&quot; in which you can escape stuff&quot;
  }.strip)

  tree # =&gt; {:string=&gt;&quot;This is a \\\&quot;String\\\&quot; in which you can escape stuff&quot;}

  # Here's how you can grab results from that tree, two methods:

  # 1)
  Pattern.new(:string =&gt; simple(:x)).each_match(tree) do |dictionary|
    puts &quot;String contents (method 1): #{dictionary[:x]}&quot;
  end

  # 2)
  transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
    rule(:string =&gt; simple(:x)) {
      puts &quot;String contents (method 2): #{x}&quot; }
  end
  transform.apply(tree)

COMPATIBILITY

<p>
This library should work with both ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9.
