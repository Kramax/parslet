Parslet is a Parsing Expression Grammar
("PEG":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) Parser. These
are a different kind of grammar that recognize almost the same languages as
your conventional LR parser, except that they are easier to work with, since
they haven't been conceived for generation, but for recognition of languages.
You can read the founding paper of the field by Bryan Ford
"here":http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/popl04/peg-popl04.pdf.

Parslet makes developing complex grammars easy. It does so by

* providing the best error reporting possible (-> Error Reporting)

* generating a relatively stable intermediary tree and a totally stable
  abstract syntax tree (-> Stability)
  
* not generating reams of code for you to debug (-> Other Libraries)

A parser constructed with parslet works in two stages: 

1. *Recognition*, yields PORO (Plain Old Ruby Objects (tm))

2. *Transformation*, yields whatevery you want it to
