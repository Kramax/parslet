= 0.9.0 / ???
  * Breaking change: Ruby's binary or ('|') is now used for alternatives, 
    instead of the division sign ('/') - this reduces the amount of 
    parenthesis needed for a grammar overall. 

  * parslet.maybe now yields the result or nil in case of parse failure. This
    is probably better than the array it did before; the jury is still out on
    that. 
    
  * parslet.repeat(min, max) is now valid syntax

= 0.1.0 / not released.

  * Initial version. Classes for parsing, matching in the resulting trees
    and transforming the trees into something more useful.  
    
  * Parses and outputs intermediary trees
    
  * Matching of single elements and sequences
