= 0.1.1 / ???

  * parslet.maybe now yields the result or nil in case of parse failure. This
    is probably better than the array it did before; the jury is still out on
    that. 

= 0.1.0 / not released.

  * Initial version. Classes for parsing, matching in the resulting trees
    and transforming the trees into something more useful.  
    
  * Parses and outputs intermediary trees
    
  * Matching of single elements and sequences
